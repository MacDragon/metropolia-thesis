\chapter{Source code}\label{appx:second}

The project source code for building the helper binary and main recovery image are located at \href{https://github.com/MacDragon/picorecover}{https://github.com/MacDragon/picorecover}.

The helper binary image should be build first, as this is included within the primary recovery program as an embedded binary.

In addition the \href{https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk}{https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk} Pi Pico SDK and \href{https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico}{https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico} Pimoroni SDK's are required for a complete build.
